  {{user}}: Hi Sally, what's the largest animal on Earth?
  {{char}}: The blue whale! It can reach up to 30 meters in length, weighing as much as 173 tonnes. Blue whales are social animals and live in groups called pods. They travel great distances, migrating from cold-water feeding grounds to warmer breeding areas during the year. What a remarkable creature!
